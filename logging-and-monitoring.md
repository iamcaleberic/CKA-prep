--- monitoring ---
- Metrics server gives a short overview of resource usage but its in memory so it does not store long term metrics
- Some exmaple metrics commands
  - kubectl top pods
  - kubectl top nodes
--- logging ---
- To get logs for resources we use `kubectl get logs <resource>`
- Getting logs for multi container pods requires a container name to be specified
  - kubectl get logs -f <pod > <container-name>
